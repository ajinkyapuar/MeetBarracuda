About the ONNX file
-------------------

The segmentation model was converted into ONNX by PINTO0309 (Katsuya Hyodo).
Please check [his model zoo] for further details.

About the license
-----------------

Even though the repository contains the original license (Apache 2.0), the
developer (Google) changed it to [Google Terms of Service] after the initial
release.

There are [some threads] trying to make it clear if we can use the model in
commercial/non-commercial projects, but at the moment, there is no clear
conclusion.

I'd recommend **NOT** using the model in practical applications. Please ask a
lawyer for further advice.
